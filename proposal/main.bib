  abstract = {Knowledge based privacy policies are more declarative than traditional action based
              ones, because they specify only what is permitted or forbidden to know, and leave the
              derivation of the permitted actions to a security monitor. This inference problem is
              already non trivial with a static privacy policy, and becomes challenging when privacy
              policies can change over time. We therefore introduce a dynamic modal logic that
              permits not only to reason about permitted and forbidden knowledge to derive the
              permitted actions, but also to represent explicitly the declarative privacy policies
              together with their dynamics. The logic can be used to check both regulatory and
              behavioral compliance, respectively by checking that the permissions and obligations
              set up by the security monitor of an organization are not in conflict with the privacy
              policies, and by checking that these obligations are indeed enforced.},

  abstract = {Temporal epistemic logic is a well-established framework for expressing agents
              knowledge and how it evolves over time. Within language-based security these are
              central issues, for instance in the context of declassification. We propose to bring
              these two areas together. The paper presents a computational model and an epistemic
              temporal logic used to reason about knowledge acquired by observing program outputs.
              This approach is shown to elegantly capture standard notions of noninterference and
              declassification in the literature as well as information flow properties where
              sensitive and public data intermingle in delicate ways.},

              , with comparisons on technical subtleties that have been employed in different
              approaches. Also, we study to which degree the use of epistemics is essential for the
              analysis of security protocols. We look for formal conditions under which knowledge
              modalities can bring extra expressive power to pure temporal languages. On the other
              hand, we discuss the cost of the epistemic operators in terms of model checking

              modal logic. This framework is sufficiently expressive to capture a variety of known
              security properties, while also being intuitive and independent of syntactic details
              and enforcement mechanisms. We show how to use our formalism to represent various
              progress- and termination-(in)sensitive variants of confidentiality, integrity, robust
              declas-sification and transparent endorsement, and prove equivalence to standard
              definitions. The intuitive nature and closeness to semantic reality of our approach
              allows us to make explicit several hidden assumptions of these definitions, and
              identify potential issues and subtleties with them, while also holding the promise of
              formulating cleaner versions and future extension to entirely novel properties.},
